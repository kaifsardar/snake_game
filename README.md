## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Turtle Graphics module. The game provides a nostalgic experience similar to the iconic Nokia 3310 game. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys and devour apples to grow longer. But watch out for the walls and don't crash into yourself!

## Features

- Intuitive arrow key controls (‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è) for snake movement.
- Apples to collect for points and snake growth.
- Walls and self-collision detection to make the game challenging.
- Score tracking to compete with yourself and friends.
